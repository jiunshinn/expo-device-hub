# expo-device-hub

**Expo Device Hub** is an [Expo DevTools plugin](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/devtools-plugins/)
that lets you preview and control your iOS simulators and Android emulators right from
the browser — without leaving your development workflow. When you run `expo start`, the
Hub adds a device dashboard where you can watch a live stream of any device, interact
with it, and manage which devices are running from one place.

## Features

- Live stream of iOS simulators and Android emulators in your browser.
- Interact directly — tap, swipe, scroll, and type into the device.
- Boot, shut down, and add devices without opening Xcode or Android Studio.
- Follows your system light/dark theme, and can flip the device's appearance too.
- Feed an Android emulator's camera a PNG from the inspector's Camera section.

> iOS simulators require macOS with Xcode. Android emulators require the Android SDK
> (`emulator`, `adb`).

## Use in an Expo app

> Using the Hub inside an Expo app requires **Expo SDK 57** or newer.

Install the plugin:

```sh
npx expo install expo-device-hub
```

Then start your project as usual:

```sh
npx expo start
```

Expo Device Hub registers itself as a DevTools plugin, so a link to it appears in your
terminal when the dev server starts:

```
› Expo Device Hub: http://localhost:8081/_expo/plugins/expo-device-hub
```

## Use standalone

The Hub also runs outside of `expo start` as a standalone server — useful when you want
the device dashboard without a running Expo project:

```sh
npx expo-device-hub
```

### Screenshots in EAS sessions

The live preview's Screenshot action keeps its browser download and also saves an
artifact when the EAS session host configures `EXPO_DEVICE_HUB_SCREENSHOT_DIRECTORY`.
Both serve-sim and serve-emu write each captured PNG to a temporary file in that
directory, then rename it to `screenshot-<uuid>.png` when complete. A storage error
fails the screenshot request instead of silently returning an unsaved capture.

The EAS worker uploads completed PNGs every five seconds and flushes remaining
captures at session shutdown. Failed uploads retain their files for retry. This
requires the updated preview packages and EAS build-tools worker together; the
worker setting alone has no effect on older preview packages. Standalone previews
without the environment variable keep their existing download behavior.

## Repository structure

This is a [Bun](https://bun.sh) workspace orchestrated with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build).

| Package | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`packages/expo-device-hub`](packages/expo-device-hub) | The main DevTools plugin. |
| [`packages/@expo/hub-client`](packages/@expo/hub-client) | Device-client hooks and types that own the connection to serve-sim / serve-emu and paint the live stream. See [_hub-client_](#hub-client) below. |
| [`packages/@expo/hub-components`](packages/@expo/hub-components) | Dependency-free UI kit (`Sidebar`, `StreamPanel`, `Button`, …) built on `@expo/styleguide` design tokens, so Hub matches the Expo dashboard website. |
| [`packages/@expo/hub-apple-utils`](packages/@expo/hub-apple-utils) | Lists, creates, and boots Apple simulator devices via `simctl` (macOS only). |
| [`packages/@expo/hub-android-utils`](packages/@expo/hub-android-utils) | Lists, creates, and boots Android emulators via `avdmanager` / `sdkmanager` / `emulator`. |
| [`packages/expo-serve-emu`](packages/expo-serve-emu) | Thin wrapper of `serve-emu`. To be replaced by [`@expo/serve-emu`](http://www.github.com/expo/serve-emu). |
| [`packages/serve-sim`](packages/serve-sim) | Vendored source for [`@expo/serve-sim`](http://www.github.com/expo/serve-sim). |
| [`packages/serve-emu`](packages/serve-emu) | Source for the `serve-emu` workspace package, maintained in this monorepo. |
| [`example`](example) | A minimal Expo app with the plugin installed. |

## Getting started

Install dependencies with Bun 1.3.14 and build every package once from the repo root:

```sh
bun install
bun run build   # turbo build across all packages
```

### Run the example

The [`example`](example) app is a host Expo project that has `expo-device-hub`
installed as a DevTools plugin. Use it to see the Hub exactly as an end user would.

```sh
cd example
bun start       # or: bun run ios / bun run android / bun run web
```

### Develop

To iterate on the dashboard UI with Metro fast refresh, run `expo-device-hub` as a
**standalone Expo web app**:

```sh
cd packages/expo-device-hub
bun start          # expo start --web, on port 8081
```

This serves the [`Dashboard`](packages/expo-device-hub/src/Dashboard.tsx) component directly, so edits to the UI hot-reload without going through a host app.
A local "inception" DevTools module ([`modules/expo-device-hub`](packages/expo-device-hub/modules/expo-device-hub))
registers the plugin against itself, so the standalone app still gets the real
`/api/devices` backend while you develop.

> The device **server** is bundled (see [`scripts/build-plugin-server.ts`](packages/expo-device-hub/scripts/build-plugin-server.ts)),
> so hot reload covers the UI. After changing anything under
> [`src/server`](packages/expo-device-hub/src/server), rebuild it with
> `bun run build:server`.

## hub-client

[`@expo/hub-client`](packages/@expo/hub-client) is the **device-client layer**. The
two backends speak very different wire protocols — serve-sim streams MJPEG/H.264 and
takes binary touch packets, while serve-emu streams H.264 (WebCodecs) and takes JSON
gestures — so this package hides that behind one shared contract:

- a hook (`useIosDeviceClient` / `useAndroidDeviceClient` and general
  `useActiveDeviceClient`) that owns the WebSocket connection and exposes the live
  connection state plus input controls,
- a `DeviceScreen` component that paints whichever stream is active and forwards
  pointer/gesture/keyboard/scroll-wheel input, and
- a `KeyboardCapture` component (with `useCoarsePointer`) that lets touch clients
  type into the device with their phone keyboard via `client.sendKeyEvents`.

The serve-sim side tracks the [`@expo/serve-sim`](http://www.github.com/expo/serve-sim)
web client: host work (simulator settings, app-bundle details) goes through its typed
exec-ws actions rather than shell commands, and the vendored server in
[`packages/serve-sim`](packages/serve-sim) is the version the client is written against.

It lives in its own package (rather than inside the plugin) so the **Expo dashboard
website** can consume the exact same code to mirror devices in the browser. It is published
to npm as [`@expo/hub-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/hub-client); see the
[package README](packages/@expo/hub-client/README.md) for install and usage examples.
